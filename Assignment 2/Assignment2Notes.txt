Something involving the destructor/makeEmpty causing program to crash when exiting

WHY WOULD THE DESTRUCTOR CALL A HELPER METHOD

Make sure code different enough, well commented, no memory leaks

makeEmpty and destructor work for T alone, copy constructor messed up

Working way use Catherines code

fix getHeightHelper by using reference variable to control high from parent method
same for assignmentHelper
